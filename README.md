## Lexical and Grammatical Notes

The list of vocabulary in the AVP acts as a guideline for users. The context has an essential role to play in the selection.

---

## Lexical Notes

1. **Food and clothing, fields of study/work, names of months, names of countries, currencies, hobbies, names of continents** are dependent on the context of teaching and learning. (e.g. An instructor teaching in the EU will probably want to introduce "Euro" or a local currency at A1, but that would not be necessary for an instructor in the UAE).

2. **Fields of study, occupations and hobbies** that are very frequently used are listed at A1 and A2 level. However, teachers and curriculum designers are free to add/change these to match the context of learning as mentioned in point 1 above.

3. **Numbers** are not listed, but we are benchmarking numbers from 0 – 100 at A1 level and 101 – 2000 at A2 level. مليون as a cognate is at A2. The concept and pattern of ordinal numbers are to be introduced at A1 as they are needed for describing the ranking of places and things as well as in understanding the time in MSA.

4. The **'basic/simplified' names of Arabic-speaking countries** (e.g. المغرب, not المملكة المغربية) are to be introduced at A1. Names of other countries are to be taught from A1. This is variable depending on the teaching/learning context.

5. **People's titles** (and the culture associated with them), such as حضرتك – سي – أستاذ are to be taught at A1 (depending on the context).

6. Some **dialectal words/expressions** that are commonly used in classroom language and which learners are likely to hear outside the class and which have MSA equivalents that are contrived such as: كفاية – خلاص – صافي – ماشي – تمام – طيب – اوكي are listed at A1. Teachers are free to use other equivalents as they see fit for the context of teaching.

## Grammatical Notes

### 1. Pronouns

#### a. Subject pronouns الضمائر المنفصلة
Subject pronouns are listed as lexical items. In principle, we believe that learners should be made aware that there are 12 pronouns in Arabic, but in terms of teaching, 8 pronouns (أنا - نحن - أنتَ - أنتِ - أنتم - هو - هي - هم) are benchmarked at A1 and the rest are expected to be in the learners' active vocabulary after A2.

#### b. Possessive pronouns
Possessive pronouns are not listed, but are expected to be introduced at A1.

#### c. Object pronouns
Object pronouns are not listed, but are expected to be introduced at A2.

---

### 2. Adjectives

#### a. Gender forms
The list has the masculine form only of adjectives. It is expected that learners at A1 are introduced to the feminine forms.

#### b. Nationalities
Nationalities are not listed in the AVP, but instead, we believe that the (nisba) structure is to be taught at A1, then applied to the taught list of countries accordingly. Please see point 1 above.

#### c. Comparative/superlative صيغة التفضيل
The comparative/superlative صيغة التفضيل is to be first introduced at A2, with the exception of few examples such as أكبر - أصغر which teachers may wish to introduce at A1 due to their high frequency.

---

### 3. Adverbs

Adverbs formed out of adjectives such as كثيراً - يومياً - جيداً are listed despite the fact that students are aware of the rule of how they are structured. The rationale behind this is for learners to still learn these as separate items of vocabulary and to know that not all adjectives can be turned into adverbs using the تنوين الفتح rule.

---

### 4. Nouns

#### a. Forms
The list has the singular forms.

#### b. Duals
Duals of nouns (as a rule) are to be introduced at A1.

#### c. Sound plurals
Sound plurals (as a rule) are to be introduced at A1.

#### d. Broken plurals
In addition to raising learners' awareness and the teaching of the common plural patterns such as أفعال - فعول, we have benchmarked a list of broken plurals as lexical items to learn at A1 and A2 levels.

#### e. Verbal nouns
Verbal nouns are listed as lexical items. The rules of forming their patterns أوزان in relation to the verbs are to be gradually introduced from A2 onwards.

---

### 5. Verbs

#### a. Tense conjugation
We are benchmarking verbs' conjugation in the present tense at A1 level, while the past tense is to be introduced at A2.

#### b. Pronoun conjugation
Verbs' conjugation with the most frequently used pronouns (أنا - نحن - أنتَ - أنتِ - أنتم - هو - هي - هم) are benchmarked at both A1 and A2. The rest of the pronouns are to be introduced at higher levels.

---

### 6. Grammatical Case Ending

We do not expect learners at A1/A2 levels to learn the إعراب rules of nouns or verbs. Teachers may wish to make learners aware of what إعراب is about but not expect learners to produce it until after A2 level.
